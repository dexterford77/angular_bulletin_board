# AngularJS Bulletin Board Commenting Simulator

Overview
--------

Experience  
the  
exhilaration  
of  
upvoting  
and  
commenting  
on  
utter  
and  
complete  
gibberish

### Technical Notes

Use AngularJS and NoSQL data modeling to manage front-end commenting/upvoting data. Upvoting alters comment order in the center, while date determines comment order in the "Recent Comments" sidebar.
